## Introduction
This library is a product of studying "BoyBayKiller"s [Newtonian-Particle-Simulator](https://github.com/BoyBaykiller/Newtonian-Particle-Simulator). I will keep enhancing the library in terms of UI and buffer management while adding more primitives dynamically.

Honestly, I feel much more comfortable managing the buffers in OpenGL with C++ code but for some ongoing projects, I will brush up my C# codebase as well. I will re-implement my C++ libraries in C# using OpenTK.

## User Interface
I added a user interface using .NET port of Dear ImGui. Later on, I will change the sample interface and bind the UI input directly to Input Manager static class. I am also developing A WPF and WinForms, later on if I have time I can release those projects as well.
